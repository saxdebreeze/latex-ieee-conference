  In order to provide fast prototyping for layout migration, this software extracted the reference layout with placement and routing respectively. The migrated layout is generated according to the extracted information. and then it dumps into real design after physical verification for performance simulation. Fig.~\ref{fig:Flow} shows the overall flow diagram of our methodology.
  The flow is mainly separated into three stages: 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bf First contribution}: A contribution which related to \cite{Chin_DMR_ICCAD2013} can not only be applied to my work.
    \item {\bf Second contribution}: contribution details. 
    \item {\bf Third contribution}: contribution details.
  \end{enumerate}

  In the end, a set of layouts with refinement is obtained, which provides designers a quick look of possible solutions that can be used. The layout results are automatically dumped into industrial layouts for demonstration and simulation. 


\section{Program Setting and Results}
  
  Our Software is developed with g++ 4.1.2 for methodology, Synopsys $\text{PyCell Studio}^{\text{TM} }$ 4.7.1 for layout realization and Qt 4.8.4 for GUI demonstration. We also display the layout with the reference one and the generated layout via $\text{Cadence}^{\text{\textregistered}}$ $\text{Virtuoso}^{\text{\textregistered}}$ 6.1.5. The migration of a variable-gain amplifier (VGA), a folded-cascode operational amplifier (OpAmp) and low dropout regulator (LDO) will be demonstrated step-by-step as applications to show the feasibility of our Software.
